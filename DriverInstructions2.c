/*
Creating a simple Windows kernel-mode driver, especially one that interacts with network traffic, 
is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of Windows internals, the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), 
and network stack operation. However, due to the inherent complexity and potential risks involved with 
kernel-mode drivers, I'll outline a conceptual example focusing on simplicity. This example will guide 
you through creating a basic driver framework, without the complexities of directly manipulating network packets, 
which might serve as a foundation for learning more about driver development and network filtering.
Disclaimer:

This example is intended for educational purposes only. Writing and deploying kernel-mode drivers can cause 
system instability and security vulnerabilities if not done correctly. Always develop and test in a 
controlled environment, such as a virtual machine.
Prerequisites:

    Windows 10 or Windows Server with the latest updates.
    Visual Studio 2019 or later with the Desktop Development with C++ workload.
    Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10.

Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

    Install Visual Studio: Ensure Visual Studio is installed with the Desktop Development with C++ workload.
    Install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK): Download and install the WDK from the official Microsoft website, 
    matching the version to your Visual Studio installation.

Step 2: Creating a New Driver Project

    Launch Visual Studio and select "Create a new project."
    Choose a Driver Project Template: Search for and select the "Kernel Mode Driver (KMDF)" project template. Click "Next."
    Configure Your Project: Enter a project name, such as "SimpleNetworkDriver", and choose a location for your project. Click "Create."

Step 3: Writing a Simple Driver Code

    Visual Studio will generate a basic driver template. Open the main driver file (usually Driver.c or similar).
    The generated code includes driver entry and unload routines. You can add simple logging to these routines using DbgPrint:
END COOMMENT */

#include <ntddk.h>
#include <wdf.h>

VOID UnloadDriver(_In_ WDFDRIVER Driver)
{
    DbgPrint("SimpleNetworkDriver: Driver Unloading\n");
}

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath)
{
    WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG config;
    NTSTATUS status;

    DbgPrint("SimpleNetworkDriver: Driver Entry\n");

    WDF_DRIVER_CONFIG_INIT(&config, WDF_NO_EVENT_CALLBACK);
    config.DriverInitFlags |= WdfDriverInitNonPnpDriver;
    config.EvtDriverUnload = UnloadDriver;

    status = WdfDriverCreate(DriverObject, RegistryPath, WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES, &config, WDF_NO_HANDLE);
    return status;
}

Step 4: Building Your Driver

    Build Solution: From the "Build" menu, select "Build Solution." Resolve any errors or warnings that may appear.

Step 5: Testing Your Driver (In a Safe Environment)

    Sign Your Driver (for testing): Use a test certificate to sign your driver. This process involves 
    creating a certificate and signing the driver using the signtool command.
    Deploy Your Driver: For testing purposes, you can deploy your driver to a virtual machine. Use tools 
    like OSRLoader or the sc command to load your driver.
    Verify Operation: Once the driver is loaded, use DebugView (a Sysinternals tool) to view the debug 
    prints from your driver. You should see messages printed by your driver's entry and unload routines.

Step 6: Learning More

While this driver does not directly interact with network packets (due to the complexity and risks), 
the example provides a foundation for understanding the basics of Windows driver development. 
To extend this into network filtering:

    Explore Windows Filtering Platform (WFP): Microsoft's WFP provides a comprehensive API for creating network 
    filtering solutions. Start with Microsoft's official documentation and examples.
    Incremental Learning: Focus on understanding one aspect of the WFP API at a time, such as inspecting packets, 
    before attempting to write or modify packet contents.

Important Notes:

    Testing Environment: Always develop and test kernel-mode drivers in a virtual machine or a test 
    environment to avoid potential damage to your primary system.
    Security and Stability: Kernel-mode drivers operate at a high privilege level. Ensure your driver 
    does not compromise system stability or security.
    Compliance: Follow best practices for driver signing and deployment in production environments.

Developing a driver that manipulates network packets is an advanced topic. It's recommended to gain a 
solid understanding of driver development and Windows internals before attempting to implement such functionality.
